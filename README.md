# Configs

#### my config are now managed using home-manager, see [vite-mon-vim](https://github.com/briossant/vite-mon-vim) for vim

Some of my configs (old) for linux & softwares.

Each config is stored in a seperate directory.

I am slowly building my [NixOs flake](https://github.com/briossant/Nix-sa-mere-Os) so this repo is slowly becoming obselete.
